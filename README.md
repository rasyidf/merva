# MERVA Codebase

Developing a super-app can be complex, especially when managing a large codebase. The **MERVA Codebase** is designed to simplify this process by providing a modular foundation that supports efficient development. 

MERVA is structured as a **monolith** with modularity in mind, allowing developers to encapsulate each feature into self-contained modules. This means you can start new projects by copying existing module folders into the new project with minimal configuration, enabling faster development and reuse of code.

MERVA uses **Bun** as the package manager and runtime, delivering improved performance and enhanced tooling for modern JavaScript projects.

## Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>

The MERVA Codebase offers the following utilities and features:

- **Modular Structure**: Each feature is encapsulated in a reusable module, simplifying future projects.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Automatically handle navigation between different modules and features.
- **Feature Flagging**: Enable or disable specific features without codebase alterations.
- **Global Error Handling**: Standardized error handling across all modules for better stability.
- **Shared Services**:
  - **Logging**: Track performance and log issues efficiently.
  - **Notification Service**: Real-time communication with users via alerts and notifications.
  - **Authentication**: Centralized user access and authentication management for all modules.
- **State Management**: Maintain a global state while enabling independent module development.
- **API Integration**: Streamlined connection to external services and APIs with built-in retry logic.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimized for speed and resource management using Bun.
- **Testing Suite**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing tools for the entire codebase.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Support for multiple languages and locales out of the box.

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

To start developing with the MERVA Codebase:

1. Clone the repository and set up the environment:
   ```bash
   npx degit https://github.com/rasyidf/merva.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies using Bun:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```
3. Set up your environment variables by following the instructions in `.env.example`.
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```
5. Begin development by creating and configuring your modules, or reuse existing ones by copying them into your project with minimal setup.
