# MERVA Codebase

Developing a super-app can be a challenging task, especially when you have to write the same code repeatedly. The MERVA codebase is designed to alleviate this pain by providing a comprehensive set of tools and utilities that streamline the development process, allowing you to create your super-app quickly and efficiently.

MERVA is a Monorepo designed with Module Federation in mind, enabling developers to dynamically load mini-apps and features within a web app. This allows for the independent development of each feature within its mini-app while still maintaining shared information and state management (such as authentication, payment, and database).
