# Since the ".env" file is gitignored, you can use the ".env.example" file to
# build a new ".env" file when you clone the repo. Keep this file up-to-date
# when you add new variables to `.env`.

# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any
# secrets in it. If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named
# ".env" and populate it with your secrets.

# Example:
# SERVERVAR="foo"
# MERVA_APP_NAME="MERVA"
# MERVA_APP_NAME_SHORT="MRV"
# MERVA_APP_VERSION="0.1"
# MERVA_APP_URL="https://localhost:3000"
# MERVA_API_URL="https://localhost:3001"
